# SourceIRC -> Player Data

This SourceMod addon is a module for the [SourceIRC](https://github.com/Azelphur/SourceIRC) plugin by @Azelphur
This is a simple addition that allows you to see details about a specific player, by using using the following command from IRC: **playerinfo <target>**.

An example output:

> -Notice- {from `IRCBot} Player: Monster Killer (STEAM_0:1:20319872) Team: Blue IP: 0.1.2.3:27005 Time: 0:29 Latency: 136.
